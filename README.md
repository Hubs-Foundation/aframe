This is a **highly modified** version of A-Frame specifically for use in Hubs. All of the built in systems and most of the built in components have been removed and there are many hardcoded assumptions specific to Hubs. Unless you are working on the core Hubs codebase, you are probably looking for [A-Frame](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe).
